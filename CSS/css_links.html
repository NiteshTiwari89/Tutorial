                <br><hr><br><hr><br>
                <p>Links serve to connect and navigate between one webpage and another, with CSS properties offering options to style these links in a variety of ways.</p><br>
                <h3>Link States</h3><br>
                <p>The idea of link states involves understanding the different states in which links might exist. Various pseudo-classes can be used to style these states.</p><br>
                <ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
                    <li><p><b>Link</b> - A link styled with the <a href="css_pseudo-class-link.htm" target="_blank">:link</a> pseudo class that has a destination (rather than merely being a named anchor).</p></li>
                    <li><p><b>Visited</b> - A link with the <a href="css_pseudo-class-visited.htm" target="_blank">:visited</a> pseudo class style that indicates it has already been visited (it is present in the browser's history).</p></li>
                    <li><p><b>Hover</b> - A link styled with the <a href="css_pseudo-class-hover.htm" target="_blank">:hover</a> pseudo class that is hovered over by the user's mouse cursor.</p></li>
                    <li><p><b>Focus</b> - A focused link is styled with the <a href="css_pseudo-class-focus.htm" target="_blank">:focus</a> pseudo class. It can be focused dynamically using <b>HTMLElement.focus()</b>, or it can be shifted to by the user using the Tab key or any comparable keyboard shortcut.</p></li>
                    <li><p><b>Active</b> - A link with the <a href="css_pseudo-class-active.htm" target="_blank">:active</a> pseudo class applied when it is activated, such as when it is clicked.</p></li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <h3>Default Styles of Links</h3><br>
                <p>Properties of default links</p>
                <br>
                <ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
                    <li><p>Links are underlined.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Unvisited links are blue.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Visited links are purple</p></li>
                    <li><p>The mouse pointer changes to a little hand icon when you hover over a link.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Focused links are visually highlighted with an outline. You can navigate to links on this page using the keyboard by pressing the tab key. On Mac, use option + tab or enable Full Keyboard Access: All controls with Ctrl + F7.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Active links are styled in red. You can test this by holding down the mouse button while clicking on the link.</p></li>
