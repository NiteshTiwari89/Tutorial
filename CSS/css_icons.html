                <p>The CSS icons are used to add graphical representations, symbols, or small images to web elements.
                    They serve several purposes in web development, such as:</p><br>

                    <li>
                        <p><b>Enhanced user experience</b>: Provides visual cues and context to various elements on a
                            webpage, like instead of adding the text save, delete, etc. you may add an icon to represent
                            them.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>Reduced load time</b>: CSS icons are often lightweight compared to traditional image
                            icons, which means they can load quickly, reducing the overall page load time.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>Scalability</b>: CSS icons can be easily scaled up or down without loss of quality. It is
                            important for responsive web designing.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>Customization</b>: CSS icons can be customized by changing their size, color, and other
                            visual properties using CSS rules. This flexibility allows you to match the icons to your
                            website's overall design and branding.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>Accessibility</b>: CSS icons can be styled to meet accessibility standards, such as
                            providing alternative text for screen readers.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>Reduced HTTP Requests</b>: Using CSS icons can reduce the number of HTTP requests made by
                            a webpage since they are often part of the stylesheet.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Popular CSS icon libraries like Font Awesome, Material Icons, or custom icon sets are also widely
                    used to simplify the process of adding icons to web applications.</p>

                <h2>Adding Icons</h2>
                <br>
                <p>Some of the common methods though which we can add CSS icons are as follows:</p>
                <br>

                    <li>
                        <p><b>Using CSS pseudo-elements (::before and ::after)</b>: Involves using the <b>::before</b>
                            and <b>::after</b> pseudo-elements to insert content before or after an HTML element and
                            then styling that content to display an icon.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>Icon fonts</b>: Icon fonts are custom fonts that contain icons as glyphs. You can use
                            these fonts to display icons by setting the appropriate font-family and specifying the
                            icon's Unicode character.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>Inline SVGs</b>: Involves embedding SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) directly into your HTML
                            code. You can create or obtain SVG icons and insert them as inline elements.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>CSS background images</b>: You can use CSS background images to display icons by setting
                            the <b><a href="css_background-image.htm" target="_blank">background-image</a></b> property
                            on an element.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>CSS Libraries and Frameworks</b>: Many CSS libraries and frameworks, like Font Awesome,
                            Material Icons, and Bootstrap Icons, provide pre-designed sets of icons that you can easily
                            include in your projects. They often come with ready-to-use classes or utility classes.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><b>Custom CSS</b>: You can create your own custom CSS for icons by designing and styling them
                            using CSS properties like width, height, border, border-radius, and more. This approach
                            gives you full control over the design of your icons.</p>
