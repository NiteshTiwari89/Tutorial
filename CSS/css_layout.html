                <p>The chapter will list fundamental tools and techniques available for CSS layout. Let us look at
                    each topic.</p><br>
                <h3>CSS Layout - Normal flow</h3><br>
                <p>This section explains about the normal flow of a webpage, where the elements position or lay
                    themselves as per this flow. The normal flow is the basic ground for any changes that you intend
                    to do.</p>
                <br>
                <p>A <b>box model</a></b> is applied to the individual elements, where padding, border, or margin
                    are added to the content. A <b>block-level</b> element fills the available inline space of the
                    parent element with its content, by default; whereas an <b>inline-level</b> element's size is
                    same as its content's size. For the elements that have a <b>display</a></b> value of
                    <b>inline</b>, you can set the <b>width</a></b> or <b>height</a></b>
                </p>
                <p>In the normal layout flow, the <b>block-level</b> elements are positioned in the <b>block flow
                        direction</b>, which is as per the parent's writing mode. Each block-level element will
                    appear in a new line below the last line, separated by the specified margin.</p>
                <p>The <b>inline-level</b> elements do not appear on a new line, rather they appear in the same line
                    along with other text content, till the time they have space to be inside the width of the
                    parent block level element. When there is no space left, then the content will fall into a new
                    line.</p><br>
                <h3>CSS Layout - Flexbox</a></h3><br>
                <p>Laying out of elements in rows and columns, in a one-dimensional space, is taken care by the
                    <b>flexbox</a></b> layout. In this layout the items or
                    elements flex in order to fill the space and at the same time they may shrink to fit in the
                    smaller spaces.
                </p><br>
                <h3>CSS Layout - Grids</h3><br>
                <p>Layout system of positioning elements in a two-dimensional space, is the responsibility of the
                    <b>grid</a></b> layout. It helps in laying the
                    content in rows and columns and make the whole building complex layout easy.
                </p><br>
                <h3>CSS Layout - Floats</a></h3><br>
                <p>CSS <b>float</a></b> is one of the commonly used property
                    to create multiple column layouts on webpages, apart from using it to float images inside a
                    container. But with <b>flexbox</b> and <b>grid</b> features, the <b>float</b> is restricted for
                    the usage of floating images or text.</p><br>
