                <h2>What is Multimedia?</h2><br>
                <p>Multimedia comes in many different formats. It can be almost anything you can hear or see, like
                    images, music, sound, videos, records, films, animations, and more. <br><br>Web pages often contain
                    multimedia elements of different types and formats.</p>
                <br>
                <hr><br>
                <h2>Browser Supports</h2><br>
                <p>The first web browsers had support for text only, limited to a single font in a single color.
                    <br><br>Later came browsers with support for colors, fonts, images, and multimedia!
