            HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed
            to be displayed in a
            web browser. It defines the content and structure of web content. It is often assisted by technologies such
            as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.

            Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into
            multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues
            for its appearance.

            HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as
            interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured
            documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and
            other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets.
